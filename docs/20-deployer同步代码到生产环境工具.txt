什么是Deployer
Deployer 是一个基于 SSH 协议的无侵入 web 项目部署工具，因为它不需要你在目标服务器上装什么服务之类的东西即可使用，它只需要在你的开发机，或者你的笔记本，就是发起部署动作的一方安装即可。

它的原理就是通过 SSH 到你的机器去创建目录，移动文件，执行指定的动作来完成项目的部署

跟我们shell脚本其实是一样的，只不过，我们不需要去服务器上面进行操作，而且在本地恋用熟悉的php进行编写部署脚本后，通过ssh协议，登录到指定服务器进行一系列操作，所以说还是很友好的。

 Contribute to the Deployer Development

 In order to help development and improve the features in Deployer,
 Deployer has a setting for usage data collection. This function
 collects anonymous usage data and sends it to Deployer. The data is
 used in Deployer development to get reliable statistics on which
 features are used (or not used). The information is not traceable
 to any individual or organization. Participation is voluntary,
 and you can change your mind at any time.

 Anonymous usage data contains Deployer version, php version, os type,
 name of the command being executed and whether it was successful or not,
 exception class name, count of hosts and anonymized project hash.

 If you would like to allow us to gather this information and help
 us develop a better tool, please add the code below.

     set('allow_anonymous_stats', true);

 This function will not affect the performance of Deployer as
 the data is insignificant and transmitted in a separate process.

 Do you confirm? (yes/no) [yes]:
 > yes
